\section{Pro tips \label{sec:proTips}}

    \subsection{Vim is your bro}

    So you want to write a thesis bruh. You can write some cool text like this.
    And some cool text like that. You can keep you text nicely wrapped by
    putting
    \begin{verbatim}
        set textwidth=80        " Go to new line if you write further than 80 column
        set colorcolumn=80      " Display limit at column=80
    \end{verbatim}
    in your .vimrc, and using « gq » in vim to nicely rewrap a block of text you
    just edited.

    \subsection{Macros}

    There are some cool macros defined in template/macros.tex. For instance you
    can make reference like this : \refsection{sec:proTips}.

    For math stuff, don't hesitate to use macros, especially for units.
    You can have equations like this (\refequation{eq:someEquation} and
    \refequation{eq:someOtherEquation}) :
    % One line only
    \eq{someEquation}
    {
        \pT = 5\TeV
    }
    and
    % Several lines, aligned according to the &
    \eqalign{someOtherEquation}
    {
        \mass{t}                                 & = 172\GeV    \nonumber\\
        \mathcal{L}                              & = 20\invfb   \nonumber\\
        \sigma(pp \rightarrow \text{barbapapas}) & = 42\pb
    }
    For stuff specific to your work, you sould also create macros in
    ./template/macros.tex to avoid typing identical bunches of stuff hundreds of
    times.

    \subsection{Figures}

    Keep your images and stuff organized in ./assets/ (you might have a lot of
    them). There are some macros to easily add plots without the whole
    begin{figure} crap. Checkout \reffig{fig:meme/doge} and
    \reffig{fig:cats/twoCats}.

    \insertFigure{meme/doge} % Filename = label
                 {0.6}       % Width, in fraction of the whole page width
                 {Representation of the Higgs potential with $\mu^2 < 0$ and
                 $\lambda > 0$.} % Caption

    \insertTwoFigures{cats/twoCats} % The label for the figure containing the two pics
                     {cats/2}       % Filename 1
                     {cats/3}       % Filename 2
                     {0.3}         % Width of each image
                     {Sketch of the underground installation showing the SPS,
                     the injection tunnels, the LHC, as well as the four
                     experiments.}
                     % Caption

    % (this doesn't suits every needs, so sometimes you have to do the whole
    % stuff manually yourself)

    \subsection{Biblio}

    The bibliography stuff is in ./biblio.tex. You can cite as usual with
    \cite{topPtReweighting}. In biblio.tex, you can add easily hyperlinks using
    the DOI, arXiv number, PAS id, CDS id, ...

    \subsection{Notes}

    You can leave yourself notes/todo, such as \refNeeded

    or :

    \todo{write the rest of the thesis}

    \subsection{Compile}

    To compile, just type « make ». Maybe two times if you care about updating
    the table of content and/or references.

    \textbf{Beware} that some actually useful LaTeX error might be filtered out.
    For deep debugging, you can open template/Makefile and comment the line
    starting with ERROR_PARSING=... and recompile.
